Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Thu Sep 23 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Eighteen, located about 1800 miles east-southeast of the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center has issued the last advisory on <br/>
Post-Tropical Cyclone Rose, located more than 1300 miles <br/>
west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located a little more than 600 miles west-northwest of <br/>
the westernmost Azores.  While showers and thunderstorms remain <br/>
limited near the low, only a small increase in this activity could <br/>
result in the formation of a subtropical or tropical cyclone while <br/>
it moves generally southward over marginally warmer waters during <br/>
the next day or two.  Strong upper-level winds are expected to <br/>
develop over the system by this weekend, which should then limit <br/>
further development.  Additional information on this system, <br/>
including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued <br/>
by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...60 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Another tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of <br/>
Africa by the end of the weekend. Thereafter, environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to be conducive for gradual development of <br/>
this system as it moves westward at 10 to 15 mph over the far east <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>

Public Advisories on Tropical Depression Eighteen are issued under <br/>
WMO header WTNT33 KNHC and under AWIPS header MIATCPAT3.<br/>

Post-Tropical Cyclone Rose Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
900 AM GMT Thu Sep 23 2021
 
Rose has withered away.  The cyclone has not produced organized deep 
convection for nearly 24 hours now, and therefore, the system no 
longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone. The initial 
intensity of the remnant low is held at 30 kt based on the earlier 
ASCAT data.
 
Rose is moving northwestward at 9 kt.  A turn to the north is
expected by tonight, followed by a northeast to east motion as the
shallow system moves in the low-level flow ahead of a deep-layer
trough.  The remnant low is expected to persist for a couple of
days and could produce intermittent bursts of deep convection.
However, west-northwesterly shear of 25-30 kt and dry mid-level air
should prevent the convection from organizing.
 
Additional information on Post-Tropical Cyclone Rose can be found in
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under
AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Eighteen
was located near latitude 10.5 North, longitude 36.4 West. The
depression is moving toward the west near 15 mph (24 km/h) and
this general motion is expected to continue through Friday.
A slower motion toward the west-northwest is expected Friday 
night and continuing into the weekend.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts.
Strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and the
depression could become a tropical storm later today.  It is then
forecast to become a hurricane over the weekend.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1008 mb (29.77 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Tropical Depression Eighteen Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Thu Sep 23 2021
 
Satellite images indicate that the tropical depression has been
more or less steady in strength overnight.  Curved bands remain
most organized to the north and west of the center with some dry
air wrapping into the eastern half of the circulation.  The initial
intensity is held at 30 kt as a compromise between the earlier
ASCAT data that showed peak winds around 25 kt and 2.5/35 kt Dvorak
classifications from TAFB and SAB.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be 280/13 kt.  The cyclone is
located on the south side of a mid-level ridge, and that should
continue to steer the system westward but at a slightly slower pace
during the next couple of days.  After that time, the ridge is
expected to weaken and shift eastward. In response, the depression
is forecast to turn west-northwestward to northwestward and slow
down some more.  The new NHC track forecast is largely an update of
the previous one and lies near the middle of the guidance envelope,
near the consensus aids.  This forecast is also between the GFS
model on the north side of the guidance and the ECMWF on the south
side.
 
Environmental conditions all seem to be favorable for the storm to
gain strength during the next several days.  The cyclone is expected
to traverse warm 28 deg C waters and move in an environment of low
wind shear (less than 10 kt) and fairly high moisture. Nearly all
of the models respond by showing steady strengthening during the
next several days, and so does the official forecast.  This
prediction lies near the IVCN and HCCA aids, which are usually the
most skillful.  The official forecast shows the system becoming a
tropical storm later today, a hurricane in a couple of days, and a
major hurricane by the end of the forecast period.  In fact, some of
the models suggest that the storm could get even stronger than
currently forecast.
