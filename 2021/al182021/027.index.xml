Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Wed Sep 29 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Shower and thunderstorm activity associated with an area of <br/>
low pressure located several hundred miles south of the Cabo<br/>
Verde Islands continues to gradually become better organized.  <br/>
Environmental conditions are conducive for additional development, <br/>
and a tropical depression or tropical storm is likely to form later <br/>
today or tonight while the disturbance moves west-northwestward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph over the eastern tropical Atlantic.  Additional <br/>
information on this system, including gale warnings, can be found <br/>
in High Seas Forecasts issued by Meteo France. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with a <br/>
a broad and elongated area of low pressure located several hundred <br/>
miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Although environmental <br/>
conditions are generally conducive for development during the next <br/>
day or so, interaction of this system with the low pressure area <br/>
located to its east is likely to hinder development after that time. <br/>
The system is forecast to drift west-northwestward over the next <br/>
few days.  <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure associated with the remnants of Peter is <br/>
located several hundred miles east-northeast of Bermuda. Recent <br/>
satellite wind data indicate that the circulation of the low has <br/>
become less defined, and shower activity remains limited. The system <br/>
is moving northeastward into a region of very strong upper-level <br/>
winds, and significant development of this system is no longer <br/>
anticipated.  Additional information on this system can be found in <br/>
High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...10 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Wed Sep 29 2021
 
...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS FIND SAM FLUCTUATING IN STRENGTH...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...18.9N 56.2W
ABOUT 455 MI...730 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...950 MB...28.06 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 18.9 North, longitude 56.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  A turn toward the north is forecast by Friday.  On the
forecast track, Sam will pass well to the east and northeast of
the northern Leeward Islands through tonight.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from reconnaissance 
aircraft data is 950 mb (28.06 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles
during the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or two, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 27</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  27
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Wed Sep 29 2021
 
The eye of Sam has become cloud filled in infrared satellite
imagery overnight, but the ring of deep convection surrounding the
eye has cooled. There appears to be a southwest-to-northeast tilt to
Sam's circulation as some modest southwesterly shear seems to be
impinging on the hurricane.  An Air Force Reserve Hurricane
Hunter aircraft that has been investigating Sam overnight shows
that the hurricane continues to fluctuate in intensity.  The
aircraft has reported a peak flight-level wind of 124 kt and SFMR
winds of 108 kt.  Therefore the initial wind speed has been set at
115 kt, which leans toward the higher flight-level-to-surface wind
reduction.  The aircraft also reported a minimum pressure of 950 mb,
which is up a few millibars from the flight yesterday afternoon.  
The fluctuations in intensity that Sam has experienced over the 
past couple of days are fairly typical for hurricanes of this 
strength.
 
As mentioned in the previous advisory, Sam will be moving into a
lower vertical wind shear environment, and the expected faster
forward speed decreases the potential for upwelling beneath the
storm.  As a result, some re-intensification is forecast, but
difficult-to-predict eyewall replacement cycles could cause
additional fluctuations in intensity over the next day or two.
After 60 to 72 hours, a more pronounced weakening trend is likely
to begin as the storm moves over cooler SSTs and the vertical
shear increases. The global models indicate that Sam will begin its
transition into a powerful extratropical cyclone late in the
period, but that transition will likely not be completed until
after 120 h.
 
Sam is moving northwestward at about 8 kt. The track guidance
remains in excellent agreement through 96 hours as Sam should move
northwestward and then northward around the western portion of the
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic during the next few
days. By Saturday, Sam is forecast to turn northeastward between
the aforementioned ridge and a deep-layer trough over the
northeastern U.S. and Nova Scotia.  By late in the period, there
is an increase in spread in the guidance which is related to how 
Sam interacts with the deep-layer trough.  For now, the NHC track
forecast at days 4 and 5 lies between the TVCA multi-model 
consensus and the HFIP corrected consensus aid.  Overall, little
change to the previous NHC track forecast was required for this
advisory.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Sam are affecting the Leeward Islands
and will spread to portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda by Thursday or Friday.
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United
States and Atlantic Canada by the weekend.  These swells will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the advice of lifeguards and local officials through the
upcoming weekend.
