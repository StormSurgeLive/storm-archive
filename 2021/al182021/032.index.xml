* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 22.6 North, longitude 60.0 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and a turn toward the 
north-northwest with an increase in forward speed is expected 
tonight.  A turn toward the north is anticipated by late Friday, and 
a northeastward motion is forecast to begin on Saturday.  On the 
forecast track, the core of Sam will pass to the east of Bermuda 
early Saturday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through Saturday, with more significant weakening
anticipated later in the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC,
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday night or early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the
next few days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas
by Friday, and then spread to the United States east coast by this
weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 200 PM AST.
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  32
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Thu Sep 30 2021
 
Sam continues to look quite impressive on satellite images, with a 
20-25 n mi wide eye surrounded by very deep convection.  The 
system's convective banding features and upper-level anticyclonic 
outflow also remain well-defined, with particularly strong outflow 
to the northwest and north.  Subjective and objective Dvorak 
intensity estimates have not changed significantly since earlier 
this morning, so the advisory intensity will remain at 125 kt.  
Interestingly, aircraft observations show that Sam has been a 
little stronger than indicated by satellite-derived intensity 
estimates, which underscores the value of aerial reconnaissance 
of tropical cyclones.  Another Air Force Hurricane Hunter aircraft 
is scheduled to investigate the hurricane later today.

Sam should continue to move over waters of high oceanic heat 
content and within a low-shear atmospheric environment for the next 
24 hours or so.  Thus, it could still strengthen a little today and 
tonight. By 48 hours, decreasing SSTs and increasing shear should 
lead to a gradual weakening trend.  Around day 5, global model 
fields suggest that Sam will be merging with a baroclinic zone and 
transition into a large and powerful extratropical cyclone over the 
north Atlantic.  The official intensity forecast is in good 
agreement with the HCCA corrected consensus model prediction.

The hurricane is moving a little faster toward the northwest, or at 
about 320/11 kt.  During the next couple of days, a gradual turn 
toward the north is likely as Sam rounds the western end of a large 
subtropical anticyclone over the eastern and central Atlantic. 
Thereafter, Sam is forecast to move generally northeastward in the 
flow between the anticyclone and a trough near Atlantic Canada.  
The NHC forecast is very similar to a consensus of the typically 
reliable GFS and ECMWF predictions, with a little bit of smoothing 
around days 3-4.
 
Although the core of Sam is forecast to pass east of Bermuda early
Saturday, the tropical-storm-force wind field is forecast to expand
and could pass very close to the island beginning late Friday night
or early Saturday. Therefore, a Tropical Storm Watch is in effect 
for Bermuda.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the Northern Leeward Islands
and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the next
few days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas by
Friday, and then spread to the United States east coast by this
weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local
weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday night or early Saturday, and a Tropical Storm Watch has
been issued for that island.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   5
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
200 PM CVT Thu Sep 30 2021
 
Victor remains a sprawling tropical storm with numerous curved bands
surrounding the center.  The associated convection remains most
organized on the storm's west side.  The latest Dvorak estimates are
largely unchanged and range from 35 to 45 kt.  In addition, an
ASCAT-B pass from around 12Z showed maximum winds in the 35-40 kt
range.  Based on all of this data, the initial intensity is held at
40 kt.  The ASCAT data also showed that the wind field is quite
broad with tropical-storm-force winds extending about 90 n mi north
of the center.
 
Victor is still moving west-northwestward, or 290 degrees, at 12 kt.
The storm is forecast to continue on that same general track for
another day or so as it remains on the south side of a deep-layer
ridge over the subtropical eastern Atlantic.  By late Friday, a mid-
to upper-level low is expected to form over the central Atlantic,
and that feature should erode the western portion of the ridge.  As
a result, Victor is expected to turn northwestward by the weekend
and then northward early next week when it is forecast to move in
the flow between the ridge and the low.  The model tracks have
converged compared to yesterday, but the ECMWF remains the slowest
and westernmost solution and the HWRF is still the easternmost
model.  The NHC track forecast is nudged to the west of the
previous one and lies close to the various consensus aids and is in
fair agreement with the GFS.
 
The storm has about another 36 hours in conducive environmental 
conditions of very low wind shear, a moist mid-level airmass, and 
warm 28-29 degree C SSTs.  Therefore, intensification seems likely 
during that time period, but given the broad nature of the system's 
wind field, Victor will likely gain strength slowly during that time 
period.  However, in a couple of days, the models show a significant 
increase in southwesterly shear and a progressively drier airmass.  
These negative factors for the storm along with slightly cooler SSTs 
should cause Victor to lose strength.  In fact, some of the models 
suggest that Victor could dissipate by the end of the forecast 
period.  The new NHC intensity forecast is a little lower than the 
previous one.  It should be noted that although this forecast no 
longer explicitly shows Victor becoming a hurricane, it could occur 
in a day or two before conditions become hostile.  This forecast 
lies near the high end of the model guidance.
