Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Oct 3 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located more than 600 miles south-southwest of Cape Race, <br/>
Newfoundland, and on Tropical Depression Victor, located over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
A large area of disorganized cloudiness and showers over the <br/>
southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic waters is <br/>
associated with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are expected <br/>
to be only marginally conducive, and any development of this system <br/>
should be slow to occur while it moves west-northwestward at around <br/>
10 mph through Monday, followed by a slow northwestward motion <br/>
through the end of the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>

PRESSURE SYSTEM ON MONDAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...37.7N 54.6W
ABOUT 625 MI...1010 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...100 MPH...155 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...964 MB...28.47 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near 
latitude 37.7 North, longitude 54.6 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h).  A northeastward motion at 
a faster forward speed is expected over the next couple of days.  
The cyclone is forecast to slow down over the north Atlantic around 
midweek. 
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 100 mph (155 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Gradual weakening is forecast during the next few days, and 
Sam is expected to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone 
on Monday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 45 miles (75 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240 miles
(390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 964 mb (28.47 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  44
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
Sam's cloud pattern remains quite symmetric for a hurricane moving
into the higher latitudes. The eye has become more apparent in both
visible and infrared satellite imagery over the past few hours. A
very timely 1155 UTC GMI microwave image also reveals a well-defined
inner eye that was surrounded by an outer ring of convection at a
much larger radius.  A blend of the T- and CI-numbers from the
lastest subjective Dvorak classifications yields an initial
intensity of 85 kt, this is also supported by earlier UW/CIMSS 
SATCON estimates.
 
The vertical shear over Sam is expected to remain low for the next
6-12 hours and only gradual weakening is anticipated while the
system moves over gradually decreasing SSTs.  Later tonight, Sam is
expected to move over much cooler waters north of the north wall of
the Gulf Stream and into an area of increasing southwesterly shear,
which should result in continued weakening.  However, a strong
mid-tropospheric trough approaching Sam from the west on Monday is
expected to result in a fairly quick transition of Sam to a large
and powerful extratropical low.  The low is forecast to gradually
weaken over the far north Atlantic during the middle to latter
portions of the week as the baroclinic forcing decreases. The
latest NHC intensity forecast is similar to the previous advisory
and is a blend of the various intensity aids during the early
portion of the period, but leans toward the global model guidance
during the post-tropical phase.
 
Sam is moving northeastward or 050/14 kt. The cyclone should
continue to move northeastward in the flow between a strong
subtropical ridge over the eastern Atlantic and mid-latitude
trough over Atlantic Canada.  As this trough approaches Sam from
the west, a much faster northeastward motion is expected by Monday
and Monday night. Around midweek, the post-tropical cyclone is
forecast to slow down as it rotates around a large cut-off low
over the north Atlantic.  After that time, the low is forecast to
resume a northeastward motion before it slows once again to the
southwest of Iceland. Given the future complex interactions of the
post-tropical low with the cut-off low and trough over the north
Atlantic, the track guidance is in surprisingly good agreement, and
the NHC forecast is near a blend of the ECMWF and GFS global
models.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  17
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 AM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
Despite persistent southwesterly vertical wind shear, Victor has 
managed to maintain an area of deep convection to the northeast of 
its low-level center through the morning hours. The latest objective 
and subjective satellite estimates range from 30-35 kt. However, an 
ASCAT-A pass from 1110 UTC indicates the increasingly elongated 
center of Victor is about 45 n mi south of previous estimates, which 
puts the center farther away from the edge of the convective 
overcast. Although a few 35-kt ASCAT wind vectors are noted, these 
retrievals are collocated with the most intense convection and 
appear artificially high when compared to the surrounding 20 to 
30-kt wind field. Thus, the initial intensity of Victor is held at 
30 kt for this advisory.
 
The SHIPS guidance indicates 15-20 kt of vertical wind shear will 
persist over Victor today, with even stronger shear expected on 
Monday. Additionally, the dry mid-level environment that Victor is 
embedded within appears unfavorable for sustaining deep convection. 
Therefore, gradual weakening is expected early this week, and Victor 
is forecast to lose its convection and degenerate into a remnant low 
by late Monday. Another plausible scenario is that Victor's 
low-level center continues to lose definition and the system opens 
up into a trough with the next couple of days. Either way, Victor 
does not appear to have much of a future. A subtropical ridge over 
the eastern Atlantic is steering Victor northwestward, or 310/10 kt. 
A northwestward motion is expected to continue through dissipation 
as Victor moves around the southwestern periphery of the subtropical 
ridge. Although the track reasoning has not changed, the official 
NHC forecast track lies to the left of the previous advisory due to 
the center relocation described above.
