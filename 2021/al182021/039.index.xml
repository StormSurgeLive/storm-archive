...TROPICAL STORM WARNING DISCONTINUED FOR THE ISLAND...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...32.8N 60.5W
ABOUT 255 MI...405 KM E OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 1035 MI...1665 KM SSW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NNE OR 20 DEGREES AT 17 MPH...28 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...945 MB...27.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has discontinued the Tropical Storm
Warning for Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located near 
latitude 32.8 North, longitude 60.5 West.  Sam is moving toward
the north-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h), and this motion is
expected to continue today.  A turn toward the northeast is 
expected by tonight, with an increase in forward speed forecast 
through Monday.  On the forecast track, Sam will continue to move 
away from Bermuda.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 130 mph (215 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional weakening is 
forecast during the next few days, but Sam is expected to remain a 
major hurricane through today or tonight.  Sam is likely to become 
a hurricane-force post-tropical low by Monday night or early 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205
miles (335 km).  Several automated stations on Bermuda have recently 
reported wind gusts near 40 mph (65 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  A few wind gusts to tropical storm force will still be
possible on Bermuda this morning.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the
next couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada today.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 39</title>
<description>Issued at 500 AM AST Sat Oct 02 2021  <![CDATA[<pre>
ZCZC MIATCDAT3 ALL

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  39
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Sat Oct 02 2021
 
The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters conducted their final
mission into Sam a few hours ago and found that the hurricane is
still of category 4 intensity, but the maximum winds have decreased
some.  The crew reported a peak 700-mb flight-level wind of 130 kt
(equating to surface winds of 115-120 kt) and unflagged SFMR winds
of 110-115 kt.  Based on these wind data, Sam's intensity is now
estimated to be 115 kt.  This value is at the upper end of the 
latest satellite estimates, which range from 100-115 kt.  The 
hurricane's central pressure has also risen to 945 mb.
 
Sam is still moving toward the north-northeast with a motion of
020/15 kt.  The hurricane is entering the area between a deep-layer
ridge to the east and a large mid- to upper-level low over Atlantic
Canada, and this flow should cause Sam to turn toward the northeast
by tonight and then maintain that general heading for much of the
forecast period.  The storm is also expected to accelerate,
reaching a peak forward speed of more than 25 kt in 60-72 hours.  
The track guidance is tightly clustered through day 3, but there is
significantly more spread on days 4 and 5 due to uncertainty on
exactly how Sam will interact with the aforementioned
mid-/upper-level low.  The NHC forecast has been placed near a
blend of the GFS-ECMWF mean and the HCCA consensus aid, which
necessitated a northward shift from the previous forecast only on
days 4 and 5.
 
Deep-layer southerly shear of 15-20 kt appears to be contributing
to Sam's current weakening.  Continued shear and cooler waters
along Sam's path should lead to additional weakening in the coming
days, although not at a rapid rate due to some baroclinic forcing.
Global models suggest that Sam will begin extratropical transition
in about 48 hours, with that process completing by 72 hours.  The
NHC intensity forecast closely follows the HCCA and IVCN consensus
aids during Sam's tropical phase, but then transitions to a blend of
the GFS and ECMWF global model guidance on days 3 through 5 during
its extratropical phase.  Sam is expected to continue producing
hurricane-force winds through at least day 3, with more significant
weakening occurring on days 4 and 5 once it is a vertically stacked
occluded low.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the next
couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada today.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
2. Although the Tropical Storm Warning for Bermuda has been
discontinued, a few wind gusts to tropical storm force will still
be possible on the island during the morning.

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Victor was
located near latitude 12.8 North, longitude 36.3 West. Victor is
moving toward the west-northwest near 13 mph (20 km/h), and this
general motion is expected to continue with a gradual turn toward 
the northwest over the next several days.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph (85 km/h) with 
higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast during the next few 
days, and Victor is now forecast to become a remnant low by Monday.
 
Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles (205 km)

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 AM AST Sat Oct 02 2021
 
Victor's satellite appearance has continued to degrade this morning 
with the closest convection now located more than 150 nmi northeast 
of the fully exposed low-level circulation center. Thus, Victor no 
longer technically meets the convective criterion of a tropical 
cyclone. However, tropical cyclone status is being maintained for 
this advisory out of continuity with the previous advisory and just 
in case a burst of deep convection redevelops later today near the 
still-well-defined low-level circulation center. Victor's intensity 
has been lowered to 45 kt based on a subjective Dvorak current 
intensity estimate of CI3.0/45 kt from TAFB, and the typical decay 
rate and spin down of a non-convective vortex over open water.
 
The motion estimate remains west-northwestward, or 300/11 kt. Victor 
is forecast to move west-northwestward to northwestward around the 
southwestern periphery of a deep-layer subtropical ridge for the 
next 72-96 hours or until dissipation occurs.  The new NHC forecast 
track is similar to the previous advisory track, and lies close to 
the tightly packed simple- and corrected-consensus track models.

Deep-layer south-southwesterly vertical wind shear of around 20 kt 
and entrainment of dry mid-level air have taken their toll on 
Victor. These unfavorable environmental parameters are expected to 
worsen, resulting in continued weakening throughout the forecast 
period. Therefore, Victor is forecast to become a tropical 
depression by Sunday, degenerate into a remnant low by Monday, and 
dissipate by Wednesday. However, the current weakening trend will 
be hastened if organized convection does not return within the next 
12 hours. The new official intensity forecast is a little lower 
than the previous advisory, and is also lower than most of the 
intensity guidance due to Victor's aforementioned severely degraded 
convective pattern.
