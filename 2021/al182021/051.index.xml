For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam located over the far North Atlantic several hundred miles to <br/>

<br/>
A large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms continues <br/>
over the southeastern Bahamas and adjacent southwestern Atlantic <br/>
waters in association with a surface trough.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
not expected to be favorable for significant tropical development <br/>
of this system while it moves slowly northwestward over the next <br/>
several days.  By this weekend, the system is forecast to interact <br/>
with a front near the coast of the southeastern United States.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

...SAM TRANSITIONS TO A POWERFUL POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE OVER THE FAR
NORTH ATLANTIC BETWEEN NEWFOUNDLAND AND ICELAND...
...THIS IS THE LAST ADVISORY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 900 AM GMT...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...51.0N 39.4W
ABOUT 690 MI...1110 KM ENE OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
ABOUT 1110 MI...1785 KM SW OF REYKJAVIK ICELAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...80 MPH...130 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...N OR 10 DEGREES AT 23 MPH...37 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...970 MB...28.64 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 900 AM GMT (0900 UTC), the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Sam
was located near latitude 51.0 North, longitude 39.4 West. The
post-tropical cyclone is moving toward the north near 23 mph (37
km/h), and this general motion should continue today with a further
decrease in forward speed.  A slow east-northeastward motion is 
forecast to begin by late today, and a northeastward motion is 
expected Wednesday and Wednesday night.
 
Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 80 mph (130 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Although gradual weakening is forecast during 
the next few days, Sam is expected to remain a powerful 
post-tropical cyclone over the north Atlantic today.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 80 miles (130 km) from
the center and gale-force winds extend outward up to 460 miles (740 
km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 970 mb (28.64 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland through midweek.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on Sam. Additional information on this system can be found 
in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, 
under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  50
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
300 AM GMT Tue Oct 05 2021
 
Sam's extratropical transition is well underway.  The central core
convection has decreased over the past several hours, with the
telltale elongated cloud pattern forming on the northwestern side
of the circulation.  Still, AMSU-microwave data just before 00Z was 
very clear it is still has a healthy warm core, so advisories will
continue.  The initial wind speed is decreased to 75 kt, a bit
above the satellite estimates.
 
An approaching mid-latitude trough should cause Sam to quickly
transition into a powerful extratropical cyclone within the next
6-12 hours while maintaining hurricane-force winds for about the
next day.  A slow weakening is expected after that time as Sam loses
its baroclinic forcing.  The only significant change from the
last advisory is that models are in better agreement that Sam will
become absorbed by another extratropical low in about 3 days,
rather than be the dominant center, so the 96 h forecast is now
dissipated.
 
Sam is moving north-northeastward or 030/25 kt.  The system is
forecast to slow down as it merges with the mid-latitude trough. By
late Tuesday, the post-tropical cyclone should turn east-
northeastward before it moves northward and northwestward around the
eastern portion of another trough/cut-off low over the north
Atlantic.  The latest NHC forecast is very close to the last one and
the model consensus.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, portions of the Bahamas, and
southeastern Newfoundland through midweek.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
