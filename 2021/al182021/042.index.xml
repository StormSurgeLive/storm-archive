OPEN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...36.4N 57.1W
ABOUT 520 MI...840 KM NE OF BERMUDA
ABOUT 740 MI...1190 KM SSW OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...115 MPH...185 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 40 DEGREES AT 16 MPH...26 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...955 MB...28.20 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 36.4 North, longitude 57.1 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 16 mph (26 km/h). This general track with an
increase in forward speed is expected for the next few days.  On 
the forecast track, Sam will move well southeast and east of 
Newfoundland over the North Atlantic.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 115 mph (185 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Further slow weakening is anticipated during 
the next few days, and Sam could transition into a powerful 
post-tropical cyclone on Monday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 955 mb (28.20 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  42
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Sat Oct 02 2021

Sam continues to gradually weaken.  Conventional satellite imagery 
indicates that the eye has disappeared and that the cloud tops near 
the center are gradually warming.  Various objective and subjective 
satellite intensity estimates are in the 90-102 kt range, while 
scatterometer and experimental synthetic aperture radar data 
suggest lower winds than that.  The initial intensity is reduced to 
a possibly generous 100 kt.

The initial motion is northeastward or 040/14 kt.  A faster motion 
toward the northeast is expected during the next couple of days as 
Sam is steered by southwesterly flow between a deep-layer ridge to 
the east and a large mid- to upper-level low over Atlantic Canada. 
After Sam completes extratropical transition in about 48 h, a 
wobbly motion generally toward the northeast is expected as Sam 
interacts with one or more mid-latitude shortwave troughs.  The 
new forecast track is similar to the previous track and lies close 
to the various consensus models.

The hurricane is moving toward colder water, and it is approaching 
a frontal zone over the north Atlantic.  The cyclone should undergo 
extratropical transition during the next couple of days, and due to 
a favorable interaction with a mid-latitude trough it should weaken 
only slowly as it becomes a large and powerful extratropical low by 
48 h.  After that time, the baroclinic forcing ends and the low 
should gradually spin down over the far north Atlantic.  The new 
intensity forecast has only minor adjustments from the previous 
forecast.


Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

...VICTOR STILL HOLDING ON AS A TROPICAL CYCLONE...
...WEAKENS TO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...13.7N 38.0W
ABOUT 950 MI...1525 KM W OF THE CABO VERDE ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...35 MPH...55 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 14 MPH...22 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1007 MB...29.74 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Tropical Depression Victor 
was located near latitude 13.7 North, longitude 38.0 West. The 
depression is moving toward the northwest near 14 mph (22 km/h), and 
this general motion is expected to continue over the next few days.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 35 mph (55 km/h) with higher gusts. 
Gradual weakening is forecast over the next couple of days, and 
Victor could become a remnant low during that time. The system is 
then forecast to dissipate by Tuesday.
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 1007 mb (29.74 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
None.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  14
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 PM AST Sat Oct 02 2021
 
Victor was about out of time as a tropical cyclone, but a recent 
burst of deep convection about 60 n mi northeast of its center saved 
it from being declared a remnant low this afternoon. The cyclone 
continues to struggle with dry air and strong southwesterly shear. 
Scatterometer overpasses missed Victor today, so the initial 
advisory intensity of 30 kt is based on the latest CI-value from the 
TAFB Dvorak estimate. 

The depression is moving northwest, or 310/12 kt in the flow to the 
southwest of a subtropical ridge. This general motion is forecast to 
continue until Victor dissipates in a few days. The latest NHC track 
forecast is little changed from the previous one, and is near the 
various multimodel track consensus solutions. 
 
Victor refused to succumb to the strong shear and dry air over the 
past 24 h. However, these hostile conditions are not forecast to 
abate over the cyclone for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, the 
depression should struggle to maintain persistent deep convection, 
and the cyclone could degenerate to a remnant low at any time over 
the next couple of days. The global model guidance is in good 
agreement that Victor should gradually weaken early this week, and 
open into a tough of low pressure by Tuesday. The latest NHC 
intensity forecast is unchanged from the previous one, except for 
the timing of the system becoming a remnant low.
