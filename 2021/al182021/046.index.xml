SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...39.3N 51.2W
ABOUT 520 MI...835 KM S OF CAPE RACE NEWFOUNDLAND
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...105 MPH...165 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NE OR 50 DEGREES AT 20 MPH...31 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...957 MB...28.26 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located 
near latitude 39.3 North, longitude 51.2 West. Sam is moving toward
the northeast near 20 mph (31 km/h). A northeastward motion at
a faster forward speed is expected over the next couple of days. The
cyclone is forecast to slow down over the far north Atlantic 
southwest of Iceland around midweek.
 
Satellite images indicate that maximum sustained winds have 
increased to near 105 mph (165 km/h) with higher gusts.  Gradual 
weakening is forecast during the next few days, and Sam is expected 
to transition into a powerful post-tropical cyclone by early 
Tuesday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles (110 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 240
miles (390 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 957 mb (28.26 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  46
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 03 2021

Sam still had a surprise up its sleeve tonight, with its eye 
becoming warmer on satellite images along with a stronger eyewall.  
Microwave data from earlier today indicated that Sam has been 
undergoing a concentric eyewall cycle, and it appears that the inner 
eyewall has become better defined.  Regardless, it is not every day 
you see a hurricane with that clear of an eye near 40N, and the  
intensity estimates the evening range from 90-100 kt. Given the 
concentric eyewalls, the initial wind speed is conservatively 
raised to 90 kt, but it could be higher. 

High-resolution NOAA OISST data indicate that Sam is moving near a 
warm eddy along the north wall of the Gulf Stream.  This favorable 
factor, in addition to low shear, should keep Sam's weakening to a 
minimum in the near term.  Later on, although the shear increases 
rapidly and SSTs fall quickly, Sam is expected to transition into a 
powerful extratropical cyclone late Monday or early Tuesday due to a 
mid-latitude trough interaction well east of Newfoundland.  This 
should cause extratropical Sam to maintain hurricane-force winds 
until early Wednesday.  A slow weakening is expected thereafter as 
it slowly spins down as an occluded low.  No significant changes 
were made to the previous forecast.
 
Sam is moving faster, now 050/17 kt. A northeastward motion and 
continued acceleration is forecast through Monday as the cyclone 
gets caught in southwesterly flow ahead of the mid-latitude trough. 
The tropical cyclone is expected to be the main surface low center 
as it merges with the trough in a couple days, hooking briefly to 
the left. Thereafter, the system should resume a northeastward 
motion and gradually turn northward and even westward at long range 
as it moves around another trough.  Model guidance is close to the 
previous cycle, even with the loopy track, and the new NHC forecast 
is basically just an update of the last advisory.
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands,
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, Bermuda, the eastern United
States and Atlantic Canada for the next couple of days.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.

Tropical Depression Victor Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
1100 PM AST Sun Oct 03 2021
 
In its battle against dry air and shear, Victor is far from its
namesake. The depression continues to produce only minimal deep
convection to the north. Furthermore, an ASCAT overpass near 2219
UTC casts doubt on whether Victor still has a closed and 
well-defined circulation, showing generally light winds south of 
the suspect center. However, no visible imagery is currently 
available to confirm the state of Victor's surface center, so 
advisories will continue for now. ASCAT data showed winds a little 
above 25 kt to the northeast of Victor's center, so the initial 
intensity is held at 30 kt for this advisory.
 
Victor is moving northwestward at a slightly faster speed (305/13 
kt).  Based on the ASCAT data and recent ProxyVis imagery, the 
center of Victor was relocated about 40 n mi south of previous 
estimates, which has resulted in a southern shift in the forecast 
track. That said, Victor is not expected to persist for much longer. 
The hostile surrounding environment will likely cause Victor to 
become a remnant low or dissipate on Monday. Victor, or its 
remnants, should move generally northwestward or west-northwestward 
until dissipation occurs within a day or so.
