Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 PM EDT Tue Sep 28 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with a <br/>
a broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles <br/>
southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands. Environmental conditions are <br/>
conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next couple of days while the system <br/>
moves slowly westward to west-northwestward over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located over the far eastern Atlantic <br/>
several hundred miles south-southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands is <br/>
producing a large area of showers and thunderstorms.  This shower <br/>
activity is gradually becoming better organized, and a tropical <br/>
depression is expected to form in a day or so while the disturbance <br/>
moves west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...90 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A well-defined low pressure area associated with the remnants of <br/>
Peter located about 400 miles east-northeast of Bermuda is producing <br/>
gale-force winds. The associated showers and thunderstorms have <br/>
become less organized during the past few hours, and the chances of <br/>
this system becoming a short lived tropical depression or storm <br/>
appear to be decreasing. This system is expected to move <br/>
northeastward at about 10 mph into a region of very strong <br/>
upper-level winds on Wednesday.  Additional information on this <br/>
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...40 percent.<br/>
<br/>

High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service can be <br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Tue Sep 28 2021
 
...SAM MAINTAINING CATEGORY 4 INTENSITY OVER THE TROPICAL
ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.9N 55.0W
ABOUT 530 MI...855 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 305 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...947 MB...27.97 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located by 
an Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 
17.9 North, longitude 55.0 West.  Sam is moving toward the northwest 
near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an increase in
forward speed is expected during the next couple of days.  A turn 
toward the north is forecast by Friday.  On the forecast track, Sam 
will pass well to the east or northeast of the northern Leeward 
Islands through Wednesday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected 
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a 
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter aircraft observations is 947 mb (27.97 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles
during the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a couple of days, and then spread to the United
States east coast late this week.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 PM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  25
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Tue Sep 28 2021
 
Sam has looked a little less impressive on satellite imagery this 
afternoon, particularly on the infrared channels where the eye is 
not very well-defined.  However, observations from the Air Force 
Hurricane Hunters indicate that the hurricane is maintaining 
category 4 intensity since a blend of the latest flight-level and 
SFMR-observed surface winds support maintaining 115-kt winds.  The 
aircraft also measured a quite low central pressure of 947 mb on 
two passes through the eye.  Upper-level outflow remains well 
defined except over the southwest quadrant of the circulation, and 
several arc clouds are seen emanating from the system over the 
western semicircle, indicative of some dry mid-level air in the 
environment.  However, this dry air is apparently not significantly 
affecting the inner core of Sam, given that it has remained a 
powerful hurricane.

Center fixes yield a continued slow northwestward motion of around 
305/8 kt.  There is little change to the track forecast reasoning 
from the previous advisories.  Sam is likely to move around the 
southwestern periphery of a subtropical ridge for the next couple of 
days.  A turn toward the north, ahead of a large mid-tropospheric 
trough moving off the United States east coast, is forecast around 
day 3.  Later in the forecast period, the hurricane is expected to 
accelerate northeastward within the flow on the eastern side of the 
trough.  There is good agreement among most of the guidance models 
on this general track, and the official forecast is very close 
to the model consensus.

Since Sam will remain in a low-shear environment and over a warm 
ocean surface for the next few days, some re-intensification is 
possible, and the system is likely to remain a major hurricane 
for the next 4 days or so.  The official intensity forecast is not 
much different from the latest NOAA corrected consensus forecast, 
HCCA.


Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Sam are affecting the Leeward Islands
and will spread to portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico,
Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda by Thursday or Friday.
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United
States and Atlantic Canada by the weekend.  These swells will likely
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to
follow the advice of lifeguards and local officials through the
upcoming weekend.
