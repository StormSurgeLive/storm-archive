Sam, located a few hundred miles east-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Tropical Storm Victor, located over the <br/>

over the tropical Atlantic about midway between the Cabo Verde <br/>
Islands and the Lesser Antilles has become limited. Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to become less conducive over the next few <br/>
days, and significant development of this system is no longer <br/>
anticipated. The disturbance is forecast to move westward at 10 <br/>
to 15 mph. <br/>

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
CHANGES WITH THIS ADVISORY:
 
The Bermuda Weather Service has issued a Tropical Storm Watch for
Bermuda.
 
SUMMARY OF WATCHES AND WARNINGS IN EFFECT:
 
A Tropical Storm Watch is in effect for...
* Bermuda
 
A Tropical Storm Watch means that tropical storm conditions are
possible within the watch area, generally within 48 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the eye of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 21.5 North, longitude 59.1 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion with 
an increase in forward speed is expected through tonight.  A turn 
toward the north is anticipated by late Friday, and a northeastward 
motion is forecast to begin on Saturday.  On the forecast track, 
the core of Sam will continue to pass well to the northeast of the 
northern Leeward Islands this morning, and pass to the east of 
Bermuda early Saturday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that the maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through Saturday, with more significant weakening 
anticipated later in the weekend. 
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150 miles
(240 km).  NOAA buoy 41044 has recently measured a peak one-minute 
sustained wind of 78 mph (126 km/h) and a gust to 98 mph (158 
km/h). 
 
The latest minimum central pressure estimated from Air Force Reserve 
reconnaissance data is 937 mb (27.67 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, 
and on the web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
Friday night or early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Northern Leeward 
Islands and the Greater Antilles, including Puerto Rico, during the 
next few days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas 
by Friday, and then spread to the United States east coast by this 
weekend.  These swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip 
current conditions.  Please consult products from your local 
weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next intermediate advisory at 800 AM AST.
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 29 2021
 
Sam is intensifying tonight after completing an eyewall replacement 
cycle.  A recent NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft showed peak 700 mb 
flight-level winds of 138 kt, multiple SFMR surface winds of 120 kt 
or greater, plus falling central pressure to about 940 mb.  This 
deepening trend is also seen on recent satellite imagery, with 
significant warming within the eye noted.  These data support 
raising the initial intensity to 125 kt for this advisory.  It is 
of note that the NOAA mission has been quite helpful for both the 
size and intensity analysis, with dropsondes and SFMR data showing 
that the hurricane has grown quite a bit since earlier today, 
mostly on the eastern side.  Additionally, reflectivity data 
from the core confirmed the end of the eyewall replacement cycle.

The hurricane could strengthen a little more overnight while it 
moves over a warm ocean eddy in fairly light shear.  Afterward, 
gradually cooling SSTs, falling ocean heat content, and the 
inevitable future eyewall replacement cycles should cause a 
weakening trend.  However, this will likely not be as steady as 
shown below, and significant deviations (upward or downward) from 
the forecast can be expected.  Faster weakening is expected by the 
weekend due to cool SSTs and increasing shear.  The new forecast is 
close to the intensity consensus, and is a little higher than the 
previous NHC prediction early on, primarily due to the initial wind 
speed.

Sam has sped up tonight, now estimated at 315/10 kt.  It sounds like 
a broken record, but there are no changes to the forecast during the 
first few days as model guidance is in excellent agreement on a 
gradually rightward-curving track, passing a couple of hundred n mi 
or more east of Bermuda.  Afterward, guidance is actually in worse 
agreement over the weekend, with widely divergent solutions from an 
upper-level trough picking up Sam and turning it north toward 
Newfoundland or the trough leaving Sam behind, causing a slow 
eastward motion.  The trend in the guidance is for a slower motion 
at long range, so I've elected to keep the day 4 and 5 points almost 
the same as the previous advisory, just a hair faster than the 
latest consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles during
the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or so, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

2. A Tropical Storm Watch could be required for Bermuda on 
Thursday, and interests there should monitor the progress of Sam.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   4
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
800 AM CVT Thu Sep 30 2021
 
Victor is gradually getting better organized.  AMSR2 microwave 
data from 0300 UTC showed that the low-level circulation has become 
more defined, with most convective banding features located west and
southwest of the center.  Victor's intensity is now estimated to be 
40 kt based on Dvorak estimates of T3.0 and T2.5 from TAFB and SAB, 
respectively, and objective numbers from UW-CIMSS around 40 kt.

Victor's vector is toward the west-northwest (290 degrees) at 11 
kt, and this heading should continue for the next 36 hours while 
the storm is located to the south a deep-layer ridge located over 
the subtropical eastern and central Atlantic.  In about 2 days, a 
mid- to upper-level low is forecast to develop over the central 
Atlantic, causing Victor to curve around the western periphery of 
the ridge, which gets shunted eastward between the Azores and the 
Canary Islands.  The track models are in generally good agreement 
on this scenario, and most of them are clustered tightly among each 
other.  Two notable exceptions, which are discounted at this time, 
are the HWRF and ECMWF models.  The HWRF, which is stronger than 
the other models, is way off to the east, while the ECMWF lies 
off to the south and west, a tendency that we've observed recently 
with other storms in the deep tropics.  The NHC track forecast is 
not changed much from the previous iteration and lies close to the 
GFS, HCCA, Florida State Superensemble, and TVCA solutions.

If the low-level circulation is in fact becoming better defined as 
shown by microwave imagery, Victor should be able to continue 
strengthening for the next couple of days in an environment of low 
vertical shear and over warm waters of roughly 28 degrees Celsius.  
The NHC intensity forecast is near the upper end of the guidance 
during this period and continues to show Victor reaching hurricane 
strength in about 36 hours.  Once the aforementioned mid- to 
upper-level low forms, strong southerly to southwesterly deep-layer 
shear is expected to develop over Victor and induce a weakening 
trend in about 3 days.  The intensity forecast has been lowered a 
bit during the latter part of the forecast period given the trends 
in the intensity models, but it is not as low as the HCCA and IVCN 
aids.  Interestingly, many of the global models suggest that the 
shear could be so strong that Victor might weaken to a depression 
or even degenerate into a remnant low by day 5.
