For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles.<br/>
<br/>
An elongated area of low pressure associated with the remnants of <br/>
Peter is located a few hundred miles east-southeast of Bermuda.  <br/>
Showers and thunderstorms associated with this system have changed <br/>
little in organization since yesterday.  However, environmental <br/>
conditions are marginally conducive for some further development, <br/>
and Peter could briefly become a tropical depression again during <br/>
the next day or two while it moves northeastward near 10 mph.  <br/>
By midweek, environmental conditions are expected to become <br/>
unfavorable for further development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad <br/>
area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for further development of this disturbance, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form in a few days while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is moving offshore the west coast of Africa and <br/>
into the far eastern tropical Atlantic.  Upper-level winds are <br/>
forecast to be conducive for gradual development, and a tropical <br/>
depression is likely to form in a few days while the system moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  20
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Mon Sep 27 2021
 
...HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING SAM...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 AM AST...1500 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.7N 52.1W
ABOUT 745 MI...1200 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...125 MPH...205 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...966 MB...28.53 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 15.6 North, longitude 52.0 West.  Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h) and this motion is expected to
continue for the next few days, with an increase in forward speed
beginning on Thursday.  A turn to the north is expected on Friday.
On the forecast track, Sam will pass well to the northeast of the
northern Leeward Islands Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 125 mph (205 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Fluctuations in intensity are possible
during the next days, although Sam is forecast to remain a major
hurricane through at least Thursday night.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 105 miles
(165 km).
 
The minimum central pressure estimated from NOAA Hurricane Hunter 
aircraft observations is 966 mb (28.53 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will reach the Lesser Antilles today
and impact these islands for the next several days.  Swells are
expected to reach Bermuda and the Bahamas mid-to-late week, and
then spread to the United States east coast late this week.  These
swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.
Please consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 PM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  19
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Mon Sep 27 2021
 
The satellite presentation of Sam deteriorated overnight, as GOES-16 
infrared imagery showed periodic disruptions to Sam's inner core 
convection. The eye has not been readily apparent in conventional 
satellite imagery for much of the night, although very recent 
imagery suggests an eye could be re-emerging. Data from the 
reconnaissance aircraft last night indicated that an eyewall 
replacement cycle (ERC) was underway, and some dry mid-level air 
impinging on the western side of the circulation could also be 
negatively impacting Sam. No recent high-resolution microwave data 
is available, but an earlier scatterometer pass revealed that the 
tropical-storm-force wind radii had expanded just a bit in the 
eastern semicircle of the hurricane. The initial intensity is 
lowered to 115 kt for this advisory based on a blend of the 
objective and subjective Dvorak current intensity estimates. A NOAA 
hurricane hunter aircraft is scheduled to investigate Sam later this 
morning, which will provide crucial data to assess changes in Sam's 
structure and intensity.
 
The initial motion is estimated to be northwestward, or 315/7 kt. A 
subtropical ridge to the north and northeast of Sam will remain the 
primary steering mechanism over the next several days, and Sam is 
expected to maintain a northwestward heading through midweek. Then, 
a mid- to upper-level trough is forecast to dig southward over the 
western Atlantic late this week. The deep-layer southerly flow ahead 
of this feature should cause Sam to move faster toward the 
north-northwest by 96 h, followed by a northward acceleration 
thereafter. The NHC forecast track is shifted slightly to the right 
of the previous one through the first 48-60 h of the forecast 
period, which accounts for the more northwestward initial motion 
observed during the past 12 h. Otherwise, the NHC track is virtually 
unchanged as the guidance has remained fairly consistent.  

Sam's intensity has likely peaked now that an ERC has commenced, but 
environmental conditions should allow Sam to persist as a major 
hurricane for the next several days. Sea-surface temperatures are 
expected to be 28 deg C or greater along Sam's track through 120 h, 
and the vertical wind shear is forecast to remain weak (< 10 kt) 
through at least midweek. Thus, the official NHC intensity forecast 
only shows very gradual weakening during the next several days, 
generally following the HCCA and IVCN consensus aids. Given the 
lower initial intensity of Sam, the latest NHC forecast is once 
again lower than the previous one. By 120 h, southerly shear 
associated with the deep-layer trough is forecast to increase over 
Sam, which should induce more weakening by this weekend.
