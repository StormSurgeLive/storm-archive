Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Sun Sep 26 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of Lesser Antilles.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have become a little better organized <br/>
today in association with a surface trough (the remnants of <br/>
Peter) located several hundred miles southeast of Bermuda. <br/>
Upper-level winds are marginally conducive for further<br/>
development, and Peter could become a tropical depression again <br/>
during the next couple of days while it moves northeastward at <br/>
about 10 mph. By midweek, environmental conditions are expected to <br/>
become unfavorable for further development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Monday.  Upper-level winds are forecast to be conducive for gradual <br/>
development thereafter, and a tropical depression is likely to <br/>
form in a few days while the system moves westward to west- <br/>
northwestward at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure appears to be be forming several <br/>
hundred miles southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are forecast to support further development of this <br/>
disturbance, and a tropical depression is likely to form around <br/>
midweek while it moves westward at 5 to 10 mph.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...70 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 26 2021
 
...HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT FINDS SAM HAS PEAKED IN INTENSITY...
...EXPECTED TO REMAIN A MAJOR HURRICANE FOR SEVERAL DAYS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...14.7N 50.8W
ABOUT 850 MI...1365 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...145 MPH...230 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 7 MPH...11 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...943 MB...27.85 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located 
by a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft near latitude 14.7 North, 
longitude 50.8 West.  Sam is moving toward the northwest near 7 mph 
(11 km/h), and this motion is expected to continue for the next few 
days, along with a gradual increase in forward speed beginning 
around midweek.
 
Data from the reconnaissance aircraft indicate that maximum 
sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher gusts.  Sam 
is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind 
Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected during the next 
day or so. Thereafter, slow weakening is forecast. However, Sam is 
still expected to remain a major hurricane through midweek.
 
Sam remains a small tropical cyclone. Hurricane-force winds extend 
outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the center and 
tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 90 miles (150 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on recent reports from 
the aircraft is 943 mb (27.85 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam are forecast to reach the Lesser
Antilles early this week. These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 18</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 26 2021
 
A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Sam this afternoon 
and evening found that the major hurricane likely peaked in 
intensity at around 135 kt with a central pressure of about 929 mb 
between 1900-2200 UTC when the eye contracted down to about 7 nmi in 
diameter. Since that time, however, wind and radar data from the 
aircraft reveal that Sam has been undergoing an eyewall replacement 
cycle (ERC), including significant erosion of the eyewall convection 
in the eastern semicircle, which has resulted in the central 
pressure increasing by at least 14 mb in only a few hours. The eye 
diameter has also doubled in size now. The ERC is also confirmed by 
the ragged inner-core convection and cloud-filled eye that have 
developed in satellite imagery. The advisory intensity of 125 kt is 
based on a blend of the available reliable SFMR surface wind data 
and flight-level wind data, and also using the pressure-wind 
relationship for a 943-mb central pressure.

The initial motion estimate is now 315/06 kt. A strong subtropical 
ridge to the north and northeast of Sam is forecast by the global 
and regional models to remain entrenched across the central and 
eastern Atlantic for the next several days, resulting in the 
hurricane moving northwestward for the 72 hours. Thereafter, a mid- 
to upper-level trough is forecast to dig southward just off the U.S. 
east coast, creating a deep southerly flow regime that will act to 
accelerate Sam northward on days 4 and 5. The new NHC track 
forecast is similar the previous advisory, and lies close to the 
tightly packed consensus models through 72 hours. In the 96-120 hour 
period, the models diverge significantly on when and where Sam will 
begin moving out toward the north, and the NHC track forecast 
favors the more eastward GFS solution since that model has been 
performing quite well with Sam thus far.
 
Now that Sam is undergoing an ERC, fluctuations in intensity could 
occur for the next day or two while the vertical wind shear remains 
low at least than 10 kt. Thereafter, a slow weakening trend is 
expected due to a modest increase in the wind shear from the 
southwest and occasional intrusions of drier mid-level air. The NHC 
intensity forecast is a little lower than the previous advisory, 
mainly due to the lower initial intensity, and closely follows the 
HCCA and IVCN consensus model intensity forecasts.
