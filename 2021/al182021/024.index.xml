NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Tue Sep 28 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest <br/>
of the Cabo Verde Islands continues to produce an area of <br/>
disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Environmental conditions are <br/>
conducive for gradual development, and a tropical depression is <br/>
likely to form during the next couple of days while the system <br/>
moves westward to west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over the <br/>
central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...70 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms are showing signs of organization in <br/>
association with a tropical wave and broad area of low pressure <br/>
located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.  Environmental <br/>
conditions are conducive for development, and a tropical depression <br/>
is likely to form in a day or two while the disturbance moves <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph over the eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...high...80 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...90 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A well-defined low pressure area associated with the remnants <br/>
of Peter is located about 350 miles east-northeast of Bermuda. The <br/>
associated showers and thunderstorms have increased a little this <br/>
morning, but are still not well organized.  This system could become <br/>
a short-lived tropical depression while moving northeastward at <br/>
about 10 mph before upper-level winds increase on Wednesday.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Tue Sep 28 2021
 
...AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTERS FIND SAM HAS STRENGTHENED...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...17.2N 53.9W
ABOUT 610 MI...980 KM E OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...953 MB...28.15 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located 
near latitude 17.2 North, longitude 53.9 West.  Sam is moving toward 
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this motion is expected to 
continue for the next few days, with an increase in forward speed 
beginning on Thursday.  A turn toward the north is expected by 
Friday.  On the forecast track, Sam will pass well to the northeast 
of the northern Leeward Islands on Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Data from an Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate 
that maximum sustained winds have increased to near 130 mph (215 
km/h) with higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity 
are expected during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to 
remain a major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 125 miles
(205 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on dropsonde data from 
the aircraft is 953 mb (28.15 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles for
the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda and the
Bahamas in a couple of days, and then spread to the United States
east coast late this week.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  23
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 AM AST Tue Sep 28 2021
 
The Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters that investigated Sam early 
this morning found evidence that the hurricane has strengthened. 
Peak 700-mb flight-level winds of 126 kt were reported in the 
northeastern quadrant, which after the standard adjustment would 
support an intensity of 110-115 kt. Satellite data also indicate 
that Sam's structure has improved overnight. Sam's inner core 
appears to have consolidated into a single, primary eyewall in 
recent GMI and AMSR2 microwave imagery, and the latest GOES-16 
infrared imagery shows a colder ring of convective cloud tops 
developing around the eye of Sam. This has brought the latest 
UW-CIMSS ADT and SATCON estimates up to around 115 kt. Based on the 
flight-level wind data and ongoing satellite trends, the initial 
intensity is raised to 115 kt for this advisory. The minimum central 
pressure of 953 mb is based on a center dropsonde of 954 mb with 
12-kt surface winds.

In the short-term, internal dynamic processes that are difficult to 
predict could cause some fluctuations in Sam's intensity. If Sam's 
eyewall is able to contract today, some additional strengthening 
could occur, and this possibility is reflected in the latest NHC 
intensity forecast. Thereafter, the warm sea-surface temperatures 
and weak to moderate vertical wind shear along Sam's forecast track 
suggest it should remain a major hurricane for the next several 
days. Thus, the NHC forecast only shows gradual weakening through 
72-96 h, in agreement with the consensus aids IVCN and HCCA. By days 
4-5, increasing southerly wind shear along with decreasing SSTs 
should increase Sam's rate of weakening as it recurves deeper into 
the mid-latitudes.

Aircraft and microwave data indicate that Sam is slightly tilted in 
the vertical, with the low-level center displaced just a bit to the 
south of the mid-level eye. Based on recent aircraft fixes, Sam's 
initial motion is northwestward, or 310/8 kt. This motion is 
expected to continue for the next few days as Sam moves around the 
southwestern periphery of the subtropical ridge. A mid- to 
upper-level trough is forecast to dig southward over the western 
Atlantic later this week, which should steer Sam toward the north by 
Friday. Then, Sam is expected to accelerate north-northeastward 
within the deep-layer southerly flow ahead of the trough this 
weekend. The official NHC track forecast is very similar to the 
previous one, with just a slight adjustment to the left based on the 
latest track guidance consensus aids. The along-track spread in the 
guidance noticeably increases as Sam recurves over the western 
Atlantic, with the ECMWF much slower than the GFS. Once again, the 
NHC forecast trends closer to the faster GFS solution at longer 
ranges, given its better overall performance this season.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Large swells generated by Sam are affecting the Leeward Islands 
and will spread to portions of the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, 
Hispaniola, the Bahamas, and Bermuda by Thursday or Friday. 
Significant swells will likely reach the east coast of the United 
States and Atlantic Canada by the weekend.  These swells will likely 
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions, and 
beachgoers and other interests along these coasts are urged to 
follow the advice of lifeguards and local officials through the 
upcoming weekend.
