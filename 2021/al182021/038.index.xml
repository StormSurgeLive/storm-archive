A Tropical Storm Warning means that tropical storm conditions are
expected somewhere within the warning area within 36 hours.
 
For storm information specific to your area, please monitor
products issued by your national meteorological service.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 31.4 North, longitude 61.2 West. Sam is now moving 
toward the north-northeast near 17 mph (28 km/h).  A turn toward 
the northeast is expected by Saturday night, with this motion 
continuing through Monday.  On the forecast track, the center of 
Sam will pass well to the east of Bermuda during the next several 
hours.
 
Maximum sustained winds are now near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Although fluctuations in intensity are still
possible, weakening is forecast during the next couple of days.
However, Sam is expected to remain a major hurricane into Sunday.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 205 miles
(335 km).  Several automated stations on Bermuda have recently 
reported wind gusts of 40 to 45 mph (65 to 75 km/h).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 940 mb (27.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone Discussion
under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC, and on the
web at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at3.shtml?key_messages.
 
WIND:  Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda tonight
and early Saturday.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward
Islands, the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the
next couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  37
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Fri Oct 01 2021
 
Sam remains a powerful hurricane.  The eye is still very distinct
and there are several mesovorticies evident in satellite imagery.
In addition, microwave images show a closed and symmetric eyewall.
Data from the Air Force Hurricane Hunters indicate that Sam has been
maintaining its category 4 intensity.  The aircraft measured peak
flight-level winds at 700 mb of 152 kt, which corresponds to a
135-140 kt surface wind. However, the peak SFMR winds are around 115
kt.  Dropsonde data from the aircraft show a sharp decrease in winds
around the 925 mb level, which could mean that the strongest winds
are not reaching the surface.  The minimum pressure in the eye
remains very low though at 937 mb.  Based on all of this data, the
initial intensity is held at 130 kt, but there is some uncertainty
in that estimate.
 
The major hurricane continues northward and the latest initial 
motion estimate is 355/17 kt.  The large-scale pattern consists of a 
deep-layer ridge to the northeast of Sam and a large low pressure 
system centered over Atlantic Canada.  The steering flow between 
these features should cause Sam to move northeastward at a sightly 
slower pace this weekend.  By early next week, the deep-layer low is 
expected to retreat northward, which should cause Sam to turn a 
little more to the right.  The models are in fairly good agreement, 
but there are some notable speed differences with the UKMET on the 
faster side and the GFS on the slower side of the guidance envelope. 
No major changes were made to the NHC track forecast, and it remains 
near the consensus aids.
 
Sam is expected to slowly weaken during the next several days as it
moves over progressively cooler waters and into an environment of
stronger shear.  The hurricane will likely begin extratropical
transition in a couple of days when it crosses the 26 degree C
isotherm, and this transition is expected to be completed shortly
after 72 hours.  All of the model guidance shows steady weakening
through the forecast period, and so does the NHC forecast.  This
prediction is close to the IVCN, IVDR, and HCCA models in the short
term and near the GFS model during the extratropical portion of the
forecast. Even though Sam is likely to weaken, it is still expected
to be a significant storm over the next several days.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the northern Leeward Islands
the Greater Antilles, the Bahamas, and Bermuda during the next
couple of days.  Swells are expected to reach the United States
east coast and Atlantic Canada on Saturday.  These swells could
cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
2. Tropical storm conditions are possible on Bermuda beginning
tonight or early Saturday, and a Tropical Storm Warning is in effect
for the island.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number  10
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
500 PM AST Fri Oct 01 2021

Victor is looking disorganized.  Deep convection has decreased in 
organization and coverage this afternoon. No recent microwave 
imagery has been available to assess the structure of the storm, but 
visible images from MET-11 and GOES-17 suggest that the circulation 
of the tropical storm is still elongated southwest-to-northeast. The 
intensity estimate remains 55 kt for this advisory, but this is on 
the high end of the recent estimates and could be generous.

Compared to the large changes made this morning, almost no change 
was made to the official track forecast this afternoon. The model 
consensus has shifted substantially back to the right, and now lies 
very near the previous NHC forecast. Victor is forecast to turn 
northwestward tomorrow, and then continue on that heading through 
early next week, steered by ridging to the northeast. The new NHC 
forecast is very near the model consensus through the end of the 
forecast. Despite the recent agreement between the NHC forecast and 
the consensus, confidence in the forecast will remain low until we 
see better run-to-run consistency in the track model guidance.

Shear and dry air may already be taking a toll on Victor, and SHIPS 
diagnostics from the GFS and ECMWF suggest that the environment 
will get worse with time. All of the intensity models forecast that
Victor will weaken over the next several days in response to the 
hostile environment, and this is reflected in the NHC forecast, 
which is heavily based on the IVCN multi-model consensus. By day 5, 
all of the dynamical models indicate that Victor will likely 
degenerate into a trough of low pressure, so dissipation is shown. 
Several models, including the HWRF, GFS, and ECMWF indicate 
dissipation could occur sooner than that.
