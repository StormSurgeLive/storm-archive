Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
200 AM EDT Mon Sep 27 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles.<br/>
<br/>
Satellite-derived wind data indicate an elongated area of low <br/>
pressure associated with the remnants of Peter is located a few <br/>
hundred miles southeast of Bermuda.  Showers and thunderstorms have <br/>
become a little better organized since last night, and environmental <br/>
conditions are marginally conducive for some further development of <br/>
this system.  Peter could briefly become a tropical depression again <br/>
during the next day or two while it moves northeastward at about 10 <br/>
mph.  By midweek, environmental conditions are expected to become <br/>
unfavorable for further development.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...50 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...50 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms are associated with a broad <br/>
area of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be <br/>
conducive for further development of this disturbance, and a <br/>
tropical depression is likely to form around midweek while it moves <br/>
westward to west-northwestward at 5 to 10 mph over the central <br/>
tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off of the west coast of Africa <br/>
later today.  Upper-level winds are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development thereafter, and a tropical depression is likely <br/>
to form in a few days while the system moves westward to <br/>
west-northwestward at 10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical <br/>
Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...high...80 percent.<br/>

500 AM AST Mon Sep 27 2021
 
...SAM EXPECTED TO REMAIN A MAJOR HURRICANE FOR SEVERAL DAYS...
...HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT TO INVESTIGATE SAM LATER TODAY...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 AM AST...0900 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...15.2N 51.4W
ABOUT 800 MI...1290 KM ESE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 8 MPH...13 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...952 MB...28.12 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 AM AST (0900 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located 
near latitude 15.2 North, longitude 51.4 West.  Sam is moving toward 
the northwest near 8 mph (13 km/h).  This general motion is expected 
to continue for the next several days, with an increase in forward 
speed beginning on Thursday.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher 
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson 
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Little change in strength is expected during 
the next day or so.  Thereafter, some slow weakening is forecast 
through midweek, although Sam should remain a major hurricane.
 
Sam is a small hurricane.  Hurricane-force winds extend outward up 
to 30 miles (45 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds 
extend outward up to 105 miles (165 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure is 952 mb (28.12 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will reach the Lesser Antilles today
and impact these islands for the next several days.  These swells
could cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please
consult products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 1100 AM AST.

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 18</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Sun Sep 26 2021
 
A NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft investigating Sam this afternoon 
and evening found that the major hurricane likely peaked in 
intensity at around 135 kt with a central pressure of about 929 mb 
between 1900-2200 UTC when the eye contracted down to about 7 nmi in 
diameter. Since that time, however, wind and radar data from the 
aircraft reveal that Sam has been undergoing an eyewall replacement 
cycle (ERC), including significant erosion of the eyewall convection 
in the eastern semicircle, which has resulted in the central 
pressure increasing by at least 14 mb in only a few hours. The eye 
diameter has also doubled in size now. The ERC is also confirmed by 
the ragged inner-core convection and cloud-filled eye that have 
developed in satellite imagery. The advisory intensity of 125 kt is 
based on a blend of the available reliable SFMR surface wind data 
and flight-level wind data, and also using the pressure-wind 
relationship for a 943-mb central pressure.

The initial motion estimate is now 315/06 kt. A strong subtropical 
ridge to the north and northeast of Sam is forecast by the global 
and regional models to remain entrenched across the central and 
eastern Atlantic for the next several days, resulting in the 
hurricane moving northwestward for the 72 hours. Thereafter, a mid- 
to upper-level trough is forecast to dig southward just off the U.S. 
east coast, creating a deep southerly flow regime that will act to 
accelerate Sam northward on days 4 and 5. The new NHC track 
forecast is similar the previous advisory, and lies close to the 
tightly packed consensus models through 72 hours. In the 96-120 hour 
period, the models diverge significantly on when and where Sam will 
begin moving out toward the north, and the NHC track forecast 
favors the more eastward GFS solution since that model has been 
performing quite well with Sam thus far.
 
Now that Sam is undergoing an ERC, fluctuations in intensity could 
occur for the next day or two while the vertical wind shear remains 
low at least than 10 kt. Thereafter, a slow weakening trend is 
expected due to a modest increase in the wind shear from the 
southwest and occasional intrusions of drier mid-level air. The NHC 
intensity forecast is a little lower than the previous advisory, 
mainly due to the lower initial intensity, and closely follows the 
HCCA and IVCN consensus model intensity forecasts.
