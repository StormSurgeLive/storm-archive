Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 22 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Tropical <br/>
Depression Peter, located a few hundred miles north of Puerto Rico, <br/>
on Tropical Depression Rose, located about 1200 miles west-northwest <br/>
of the Cabo Verde Islands, and on newly designated Tropical <br/>
Depression Eighteen, located about 2000 miles east-southeast of the <br/>
northern Leeward Islands.<br/>
<br/>
A gale-force, non-tropical low pressure system, the remnants of <br/>
Odette, is located about 600 miles west-northwest of the <br/>
westernmost Azores.  This low is expected to be nearly stationary <br/>
over cold waters through Thursday, but it could become a <br/>
subtropical or tropical cyclone while it moves southward over <br/>
marginally warmer waters on Friday and Saturday.  Strong upper-level <br/>
winds are expected to develop over the system during the weekend, <br/>
which would likely limit its development.  Additional information <br/>
on this system, including gale warnings, can be found in High Seas <br/>
Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...medium...40 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>

MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...1008 MB...29.77 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the remnants of Peter were located near
latitude 22.1 North, longitude 67.0 West. The remnants are moving
toward the north-northwest near 5 mph (7 km/h).  The remnants are

HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
SURF:  Swells generated by Peter will affect the Virgin Islands,
Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and portions of the Bahamas during the
next day or so.  These swells could cause life-threatening
surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your
local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

This is the last public advisory issued by the National Hurricane
Center on this system. Additional information on the remnants of 
Peter can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National

Remnants Of Peter Discussion Number  18
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL162021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Although a low-level swirl can still be seen in infrared satellite
imagery, this feature has continued to lose definition.  A recently 
arriving partial ASCAT-A overpass shows that the circulation has 
become more elongated, and Peter lacks a well-defined center.  In 
addition, the system has not produced any organized deep convection 
in quite some time.  The cloudiness and convective activity that has 
been occuring over the western Atlantic has been located along a 
trough axis well northeast of the decaying circulation center.  As a 
result, Peter no longer meets the definition of a tropical cyclone, 
and this will be the final NHC advisory on this system.  The initial 
intensity is set at 25 kt in accordance with the ASCAT data.  The 
remnants of Peter are expected to remain within an area of strong 
upper-level westerly winds, and further weakening should occur over 
the next day or two. 

The system has been moving slowly north-northwestward or 335/4 kt.  
A weakness in the low-level ridge should allow the remnants to turn 
northward tomorrow, and this general motion should continue through 
the end of the week. 

This is the last NHC advisory on this system. Additional information 
on the remnants of Peter can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued 
by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO 
header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at 
ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php

Tropical Depression Rose Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL172021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
Rose continues to be devoid of deep convection as shear and dry
mid-level air has taken their toll on the system.  Although Rose
appears to be well on its way to post-tropical cyclone status, it
seems prudent to maintain advisories a little longer since the
system is over warm waters and some convection could return
overnight.  If that does not occur, Rose is likely to become
a remnant low by tomorrow morning, and that is what is indicated in
the official forecast.  The remnant low is forecast to continue to
gradually spin down over the next day or two. The GFS and ECMWF
suggest that some convection could re-develop in the 48-96 h time
period when the remnants of Rose interact with an upper-level
trough, but the NHC forecast once again does not call for
re-generation at that time. In fact, the latest forecast calls for
the system to become an open trough by 96 h, which is supported by
the GFS.
 
Rose has continued to move west-northwestward or 285/9 kt.  The
cyclone should turn northwestward very soon as it moves around the
western flank of a low- to mid-level ridge. Rose or its remnants
should then turn northward, northeastward, and then eventually
east-northeastward as a deep-layer trough digs southward over the
east-central Atlantic.  The latest guidance envelope has again
shifted westward in the short term, and the updated NHC track
forecast has been adjusted accordingly. After 36 h, the official
forecast lies near the previous advisory and is close to the
various consensus aids.

Tropical Depression Eighteen Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 22 2021
 
The depression's organization has not improved since earlier this 
afternoon.  An analysis of the ambiguities from 0000 UTC ASCAT-B 
data suggests that the surface circulation is just barely closed, 
with the center still attached to the northern end of a trough.  
Peak wind retrievals from the scatterometer pass were 25-30 kt, so 
the initial intensity remains 30 kt.

Based on the ASCAT data, the depression appears to be moving just 
north of due west, or 275/13 kt.  Low- to mid-level ridging to the 
north is expected to maintain the cyclone on a westward heading for 
the next 36 hours, followed by a path toward the west-northwest 
from day 2 through day 5.  The more notable part of the forecast is 
the forward speed.  Global models are showing anomalously strong 
500-mb ridging developing over the eastern and central Caribbean 
Sea in 2 to 3 days, which is likely to block the depression's 
forward progress toward the end of the forecast period.  In fact, 
the current NHC forecast has the system moving west-northwestward 
at only 7 or 8 kt well east of the Lesser Antilles on days 3 through 
5.  All this means that it will probably be a few more days before 
we have a better idea if and how the system might potentially 
threaten areas farther west.  For the 5-day forecast period, there 
is a normal amount of spread among the track guidance, and the 
updated NHC forecast is very close to a blend of the TVCA and HCCA 
consensus aids.  This solution is not too different from the 
previous forecast.
 
Overall, an environment of low shear, warm sea surface 
temperatures, and a moist, unstable atmosphere appears conducive 
for strengthening.  However, there is some sort of signal being 
conveyed by the global models (e.g., the GFS, ECMWF, and UKMET) 
whereby the cyclone's surface circulation does not really tighten 
up for another 24 to 48 hours.  Given the system's current 
structure, this scenario seems plausible.  Therefore, the updated 
NHC intensity forecast shows a slower rate of strengthening during 
the first 48 hours, just a bit below the intensity consensus in 
deference to the global model solutions.  After 48 hours, the 
official forecast converges on top of the previous NHC forecast and 
still brings the cyclone to hurricane, and then possibly major 
hurricane, strength by the end of the forecast period.
