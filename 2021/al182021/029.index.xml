<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on newly formed Tropical Depression Twenty, <br/>
located over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms remain disorganized in association with a <br/>
trough of low pressure located several hundred miles southwest of <br/>
the Cabo Verde Islands.  Some slow development of this system is <br/>

west-northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
An area of low pressure associated with the remnants of Peter  <br/>
located several hundred miles south of the coast of Newfoundland <br/>
continues to produce disorganized showers and thunderstorms. This <br/>
system is moving northeastward over cooler waters and into a region <br/>
of very strong upper-level winds, and significant development is <br/>
not anticipated.  Additional information on this system can be found <br/>

...CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE SAM PASSING WELL TO THE EAST-NORTHEAST OF 
THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 500 PM AST...2100 UTC...INFORMATION
----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.2N 57.6W
ABOUT 385 MI...620 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...130 MPH...215 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 310 DEGREES AT 9 MPH...15 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...945 MB...27.91 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 500 PM AST (2100 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 20.2 North, longitude 57.6 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 9 mph (15 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  A turn toward the north is forecast by Friday.  On the
forecast track, Sam will continue to pass well to the 
east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands through tonight.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 130 mph (215 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through late this week.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 40 miles (65 km) from the
center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles
(220 km).
 
An Air Force Reserve Unit Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported a 
minimum central pressure of 945 mb (27.91 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles
during the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or so, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  29
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
500 PM AST Wed Sep 29 2021
 
Sam continues to exhibit a well-organized cloud pattern on satellite 
imagery, although there is some asymmetry of the coldest-topped 
convection around the center.  The hurricane is also maintaining 
numerous banding features with well-defined upper-level 
anticyclonic outflow.  Observations from an Air Force Hurricane 
Hunter plane showed peak 700 mb fight-level winds of 130 kt in the 
northeast quadrant which, using the standard reduction, corresponds 
to maximum surface winds of 117 kt.  However, the maximum 
SFMR-observed surface winds were 103 kt.  Based on these data, with 
more emphasis on the flight-level winds, the current intensity 
estimate is held at 115 kt.  The aircraft also measured a minimum 
central pressure of 945  mb by dropsonde.

Since the hurricane is forecast to remain in an environment of low 
vertical shear and to remain over warm waters through 48 hours, Sam 
could restrengthen a little more during the next day or so.  Since 
the Hurricane Hunters reported a concentric eyewall, 
short-term strengthening may be curtailed until the eyewall 
replacement cycle completes.  Later in the forecast period, gradual 
weakening is likely due to cooler SSTs and increasing shear.  The 
official intensity forecast is in very good agreement with the 
latest corrected consensus prediction.  Sam will likely be close to 
extratropical transition around day 5.
 
The initial motion is still northwestward, or 310/8 kt.  During 
the next few days, Sam is likely to move northwestward and then 
northward around the western periphery of a large subtropical high 
pressure system centered over the eastern Atlantic.  A turn to the 
north-northeast and northeast is expected later in the forecast 
period as Sam begins to encounter the flow on the southern side of 
a large mid-tropospheric trough moving through Atlantic Canada.  
The track guidance models remain in excellent agreement through 72 
hours, including the time that Sam passes by Bermuda.  At days 4-5 
there is some divergence of the model guidance, apparently due to 
how Sam may interact with the trough.   Most notably the ECMWF is a 
lot slower than the other global models suggesting that the trough 
will at least partially bypass it in that case.  Not much change 
has been made to the previous official forecast, however, and the 
NHC track remains very close to the TVCN dynamical model consensus. 


Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles during 
the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or so, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   2
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
800 PM CVT Wed Sep 29 2021
 
The cloud pattern continues to exhibit a large circulation with 
numerous curved bands surrounding the center.  The strongest 
thunderstorms remain on the system's west side. The latest Dvorak 
estimates from TAFB and SAB have both increased to 2.5/35 kt, and on 
that basis, the cyclone has been upgraded to a 35-kt tropical storm.
 
Victor is still on a west-northwest course at about 11 kt. There has 
been little change to the track forecast reasoning.  The cyclone is 
expected to continue west-northwestward during the next couple of 
days as it remains steered by the flow on the south side of a 
deep-layer ridge.  By late Friday, however, the models show the 
western periphery of the ridge being eroded due to a mid- to 
upper-level low over the subtropical central Atlantic.  As a result, 
the cyclone should turn northwestward by Friday night and then 
northward late this weekend or early next week.  There remains a 
fair amount of spread in the timing and location of the northward 
turn with the GFS and HWRF still on the right side of the guidance 
envelope and the ECMWF showing the slowest and westernmost solution. 
Overall, the consensus models have not changed much and neither has 
the official track forecast.
 
The storm is expected to remain in conducive environmental 
conditions for strengthening during the next couple of days.  During 
that time period, Victor is forecast to move over 28-29 deg C 
waters while embedded within a moist airmass with very low wind 
shear (less than 10 kt).  Rapid intensification sometimes occurs 
when conditions are this favorable, however, since the storm is 
broad and does not yet have an inner core, gradual strengthening 
seems more reasonable. The NHC forecast brings Victor to hurricane 
intensity in 36 hours. In a few days, however, the models show a 
pronounced increase in southwesterly shear and a notably drier 
atmosphere. These unfavorable conditions should end the opportunity 
for strengthening and promote a weakening trend.  The NHC intensity 
forecast is similar to the previous one and remains near a blend of 
the HCCA, IVCN, and IVDR consensus models.
