The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane  <br/>
Sam, located about 1150 miles east-southeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on Subtropical Storm Teresa, located about 150 <br/>
miles north-northwest of Bermuda.<br/>
<br/>
An area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with <br/>

Bermuda. Environmental conditions appear marginally conducive for <br/>
slow development of this disturbance over the next few days as it <br/>
moves northeastward at 5 to 10 mph.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 12.9 North, longitude 47.6 West. Sam is moving toward

the northwest on Monday. 
 
Maximum sustained winds have increased to near 120 mph (195 km/h) 
with higher gusts.  Sam is a category 3 hurricane on the 
Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.  Additional strengthening is 
expected over the next day or so, and Sam is forecast to become a 
category 4 hurricane by Sunday. Some fluctuations in the hurricane's 
intensity are possible early next week. 
 
Sam is a small hurricane. Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 
25 miles (35 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds

<title>Hurricane Sam Forecast Discussion Number 12</title>

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  12
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
Sam has continued to intensify this morning and now has a complete 
ring of deep convection with cloud tops colder than -70 degrees C 
surrounding a mostly clear, small eye. The latest subjective Dvorak 
intensity estimates from TAFB and SAB are both 102 kt, while the 
combined objective Dvorak intensity estimates from the UW-CIMSS 
SATCON and ADT is 110 kt. Based on this data, the initial intensity 
has been increased to 105 kt for this advisory, making Sam a major 
hurricane. The cyclone remains compact, with hurricane-force winds 
extending only 20 n mi from the center. 

The hurricane wobbled to the west over the past few hours. However, 
the 12-hour motion is west-northwest at 9 kt. There are no changes 
to the forecast track reasoning. The ridge the north of Sam 
responsible for its current motion is forecast to shift to the east 
in a couple of days as a deep-layer trough establishes itself over 
the western Atlantic. Sam is forecast to turn northwestward around 
the southwestern periphery of the ridge in about 48 h, and gradually 
increase its forward speed thereafter. The model guidance continues 
to be in very good agreement with this scenario, and the latest NHC 
track forecast is unchanged from the previous one. It should be 
noted that the westernmost guidance continues to be the ECMWF 
ensemble mean, whose members have had a low bias in the intensity of 
Sam, which is likely contributing to the westward track bias. Based 
on the NHC forecast, and all of the other guidance, Sam is expected 
to still be well to the east or northeast of the northern Leeward 
Islands through day 5.  

Environmental conditions support further strengthening in the short 
term, and Sam is expected to become a category 4 hurricane by 
Sunday. In a few days, some southwesterly shear is forecast to 
develop as the cyclone begins to round the periphery of the 
subtropical ridge. Although this should cause Sam to weaken, it is 
still expected to remain a powerful hurricane throughout the 5-day 
forecast period. The latest NHC intensity forecast is near the 
previous one, which remains slightly above the various consensus 
solutions through 72 h, and then closely follows the consensus 
thereafter.

Subtropical Storm Teresa Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL192021
500 AM AST Sat Sep 25 2021
 
Teresa is poorly organized and it likely won't be a subtropical
cyclone for much longer.  The cloud pattern consists of a swirl of
low-level clouds and a band of showers and thunderstorms that is
located more than 250 n mi northeast of the center.  This patch of
convection has been detaching from the low-level circulation and it
appears to be more involved with an upper-level low to the east of
Teresa.  ASCAT-B and ASCAT-C caught the circulation several hours
ago, and showed winds of 25-30 kt near it.  However, that instrument
did not sample the area of convection well northeast of the center,
where the winds could be a little stronger.  Given the degraded
structure of the system, the initial intensity is lowered to a
possibly generous 35 kt.
 
Now that the upper-level low has pulled away from the subtropical
storm, west-southwesterly shear is increasing across the circulation
and that should prevent convective organization and any opportunity
for strengthening.  Due to the strong shear and dry air entrainment,
Teresa is likely to become a remnant low later today or tonight and 
dissipate on Sunday.
 
Teresa is moving slowly west-northwestward at 5 kt.  A turn to the
north is expected later today, followed by a northeast motion as the
cyclone moves in the flow ahead of a deep-layer trough.
