Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 PM EDT Wed Sep 29 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located several hundred miles east-northeast of the northern <br/>
Leeward Islands, and on recently upgraded Tropical Storm Victor, <br/>
located over the eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
<br/>
Disorganized showers and thunderstorms continue in association with <br/>
a trough of low pressure located about 1000 miles southwest of the <br/>
Cabo Verde Islands.  Some slow development of this system is <br/>
possible during the next couple of days while it moves slowly <br/>
west-northwestward across the central tropical Atlantic. <br/>
Afterwards, environmental conditions are forecast to become less <br/>
conducive for development. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...30 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>
<br/>
Showers and thunderstorms have mostly diminished with an area of low <br/>
pressure associated with the remnants of Peter, located several <br/>
hundred miles south of the coast of Newfoundland. This low is <br/>
becoming poorly defined while moving northeast over cooler waters <br/>
and into a region of strong upper-level winds. Further development <br/>
is no longer anticipated. Additional information on this <br/>
system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National <br/>
Weather Service.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...near 0 percent.<br/>

Hurricane Sam Advisory Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 29 2021
 
...SAM GAINING STRENGTH AND SIZE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...
 
 
SUMMARY OF 1100 PM AST...0300 UTC...INFORMATION
-----------------------------------------------
LOCATION...20.6N 58.4W
ABOUT 350 MI...560 KM ENE OF THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS
ABOUT 900 MI...1445 KM SSE OF BERMUDA
MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS...145 MPH...230 KM/H
PRESENT MOVEMENT...NW OR 315 DEGREES AT 12 MPH...19 KM/H
MINIMUM CENTRAL PRESSURE...940 MB...27.76 INCHES
 
 
WATCHES AND WARNINGS
--------------------
There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
 
Interests in Bermuda should monitor the progress of Sam.  A
Tropical Storm Watch could be required for the island on Thursday.
 
 
DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 PM AST (0300 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 20.6 North, longitude 58.4 West. Sam is moving toward
the northwest near 12 mph (19 km/h), and this general motion with an
increase in forward speed is expected during the next couple of
days.  A turn toward the north and northeast is anticipated by
Friday night.  On the forecast track, Sam will continue to pass well
to the east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands through
tonight, and pass to the east of Bermuda early Saturday.
 
Data from a NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicate that maximum
sustained winds have increased to near 145 mph (230 km/h) with 
higher gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next couple of days, but Sam is forecast to remain a
major hurricane through late this week, with more significant
weakening anticipated over the weekend.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 65 miles (100 km) from
the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 150
miles (240 km).
 
The estimated minimum central pressure based on NOAA Hurricane 
Hunter data is 940 mb (27.76 inches).
 
 
HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND
----------------------
Key messages for Sam can be found in the Tropical Cyclone
Discussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT3 and WMO header WTNT43 KNHC.
 
SURF:  Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles
during the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or so, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.
 
 
NEXT ADVISORY
-------------
Next complete advisory at 500 AM AST.

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  30
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 PM AST Wed Sep 29 2021
 
Sam is intensifying tonight after completing an eyewall replacement 
cycle.  A recent NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft showed peak 700 mb 
flight-level winds of 138 kt, multiple SFMR surface winds of 120 kt 
or greater, plus falling central pressure to about 940 mb.  This 
deepening trend is also seen on recent satellite imagery, with 
significant warming within the eye noted.  These data support 
raising the initial intensity to 125 kt for this advisory.  It is 
of note that the NOAA mission has been quite helpful for both the 
size and intensity analysis, with dropsondes and SFMR data showing 
that the hurricane has grown quite a bit since earlier today, 
mostly on the eastern side.  Additionally, reflectivity data 
from the core confirmed the end of the eyewall replacement cycle.

The hurricane could strengthen a little more overnight while it 
moves over a warm ocean eddy in fairly light shear.  Afterward, 
gradually cooling SSTs, falling ocean heat content, and the 
inevitable future eyewall replacement cycles should cause a 
weakening trend.  However, this will likely not be as steady as 
shown below, and significant deviations (upward or downward) from 
the forecast can be expected.  Faster weakening is expected by the 
weekend due to cool SSTs and increasing shear.  The new forecast is 
close to the intensity consensus, and is a little higher than the 
previous NHC prediction early on, primarily due to the initial wind 
speed.

Sam has sped up tonight, now estimated at 315/10 kt.  It sounds like 
a broken record, but there are no changes to the forecast during the 
first few days as model guidance is in excellent agreement on a 
gradually rightward-curving track, passing a couple of hundred n mi 
or more east of Bermuda.  Afterward, guidance is actually in worse 
agreement over the weekend, with widely divergent solutions from an 
upper-level trough picking up Sam and turning it north toward 
Newfoundland or the trough leaving Sam behind, causing a slow 
eastward motion.  The trend in the guidance is for a slower motion 
at long range, so I've elected to keep the day 4 and 5 points almost 
the same as the previous advisory, just a hair faster than the 
latest consensus aids.
 
 
Key Messages:
 
1. Swells generated by Sam will impact the Lesser Antilles during
the next several days.  Swells are expected to reach Bermuda
and the Bahamas in a day or so, and then spread to the United
States east coast by this weekend.  These swells could cause
life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.  Please consult
products from your local weather office.

2. A Tropical Storm Watch could be required for Bermuda on 
Thursday, and interests there should monitor the progress of Sam.

Tropical Storm Victor Discussion Number   3
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL202021
200 AM CVT Thu Sep 30 2021

Victor has changed little in organization since the last advisory, 
with a large circulation and a complex of convective bands mainly in 
the northern semicircle.  Satellite intensity estimates from TAFB 
and SAB remain at or near 35 kt, as do other objective intensity 
estimates.  Thus, the initial intensity is still 35 kt, although the 
most recent ASCAT-A data suggests the possibility that this is a 
little generous.

The center has moved or re-formed a bit to the west during the past 
several hours, although the longer-term motion still seems to be to 
the west-northwest at 290/11 kt.  Other than the more westerly 
initial position, there is little change to the forecast philosophy 
or the forecast track since the last advisory.  Victor is forecast 
to move west-northwestward for the next 36 h or so as it is steered 
by the flow on the south side of a deep-layer ridge.  By 48 h, the 
global models forecast the western periphery of the ridge to get 
eroded by to a mid- to upper-level low over the subtropical central 
Atlantic. This evolution should cause the cyclone to turn 
northwestward at that time, followed by a northward turn by the end 
of the forecast period.  There remains a fair amount of spread in 
the timing and location of the northward turn with the GFS and HWRF 
still on the right side of the guidance envelope and the ECMWF 
showing the slowest and westernmost solution. The new forecast track 
is in the center of the guidance envelope and lies very close to the 
various consensus models.

For the next 36-48 h, Victor is expected to remain in an environment 
of warm sea surface temperatures and light vertical wind shear.  
This should allow steady strengthening, and rapid strengthening 
cannot be ruled out if the storm develops a better defined inner 
core.  Based on a steady strengthening scenario, the new intensity 
forecast is identical to the previous one, taking Victor to 
hurricane intensity in 36 h with a peak intensity of 70 kt in 48 h.  
After that time, the aforementioned upper-level low is expected to 
cause significant shear over Victor while the cyclone moves into a 
drier air mass.  This combination should cause the cyclone to 
weaken, and it is possible Victor could weaken faster than currently 
forecast after 60 hours.  The new official intensity forecast lies 
near the upper edge of the intensity guidance.
