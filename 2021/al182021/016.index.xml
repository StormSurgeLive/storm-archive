Tropical Weather Outlook<br/>
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL<br/>
800 AM EDT Sun Sep 26 2021<br/>
<br/>
For the North Atlantic...Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:<br/>
<br/>
The National Hurricane Center is issuing advisories on Hurricane <br/>
Sam, located about 900 miles east-southeast of the northern Leeward <br/>
Islands.<br/>
<br/>
An elongated area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms <br/>
associated with the remnants of Peter is located a few hundred <br/>
miles southeast of Bermuda.  Upper-level winds only appear <br/>
marginally conducive for some slow development of this disturbance <br/>
over the next couple of days as it moves northeastward at about 10 <br/>
mph. <br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...20 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...20 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A tropical wave is expected to move off the west coast of Africa on <br/>
Monday.  Environmental conditions are forecast to be conducive for <br/>
gradual development thereafter, and a tropical depression could form <br/>
by midweek while the system moves westward to west-northwestward at <br/>
10 to 15 mph over the far eastern tropical Atlantic.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 10 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...medium...60 percent.<br/>
<br/>
A broad area of low pressure could form over the eastern or central <br/>
tropical Atlantic early this week, to the west of the tropical wave <br/>
that will be moving off the coast of Africa.  Thereafter, <br/>
environmental conditions could support some development of this <br/>
disturbance while it moves westward at 5 to 10 mph through the <br/>
middle of the week.<br/>
* Formation chance through 48 hours...low...near 0 percent.<br/>
* Formation chance through 5 days...low...30 percent.<br/>

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK
----------------------
At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Hurricane Sam was located
near latitude 13.9 North, longitude 50.2 West.  Sam is moving toward
the west-northwest near 8 mph.  This general motion is expected to 
continue today, followed by a turn toward the northwest on Monday.  
Then, a northwestward motion is forecast to continue through 
midweek.
 
Maximum sustained winds are near 145 mph (230 km/h) with higher
gusts.  Sam is a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson
Hurricane Wind Scale.  Some fluctuations in intensity are expected
during the next day or so.  Thereafter, some slow weakening is
forecast.
 
Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 30 miles (45 km) from the

Hurricane Sam Discussion Number  16
NWS National Hurricane Center Miami FL       AL182021
1100 AM AST Sun Sep 26 2021

The satellite presentation of Hurricane Sam has been quite steady
over the past 6 hours.  Sam continues to have a well-defined, 12 n 
mi wide eye on visible and infrared satellite imagery this morning, 
with cloud tops colder than -70C completely surrounding the center. 
The latest subjective satellite intensity estimates from TAFB and 
SAB were both T-6.5/127 kt, while the objective estimate from ADT is 
near 122 kt. Based on these data, there is no reason to change the 
125-kt initial intensity at this time, especially given that a NOAA 
Hurricane Hunter aircraft is scheduled for a late afternoon/early 
evening mission into Sam today.

Sam is moving toward the west-northwest, or 290/7 kt.  A deep-layer
subtropical ridge to the north and northeast of Sam should generally
steer the hurricane west-northwestward to northwestward for the next
several days.  By midweek, an amplifying upper-level trough will 
move off the east coast of the U.S. and dig southward over the 
western Atlantic, which will erode the western extent of the 
steering ridge.  The deep-layer southerly flow ahead of the trough 
should cause Sam to begin recurving, with a somewhat faster 
north-northwestward motion forecast by day 5.  The latest NHC track 
forecast was adjusted a little to the left, or southwest of the 
previous official forecast, mainly at days 4 and 5, but not quite as 
far southwest as the model consensus aids.

The hurricane will likely experience some fluctuations in intensity 
during the next few days.  Guidance, however, indicates that the 
chance of an eyewall replacement cycle during the next 36 hours is 
below climatology.  Sam will remain over warm sea-surface 
temperatures and in a low wind shear environment for the next 3 
days, with less than 10 kt of shear diagnosed by the SHIPS guidance. 
It is possible that Sam's slow forward motion during the next 2 to 3 
days could cause some upwelling of cooler water, but this will 
probably not result in significant weakening.  The official NHC 
intensity forecast lies on the high end of the guidance for the 
first 36-48 h of the forecast period.  Thereafter, the NHC forecast 
is closer to the middle of the guidance envelope.  Some gradual 
weakening is forecast later in the period as southwesterly vertical 
wind shear begins to increase, but Sam is still forecast to remain a 
major hurricane through the 5-day period.

The radii were expanded slightly by 5-10 n mi in the western 
semicircle from the previous advisory based on a 1155 UTC ASCAT-A 
pass.
